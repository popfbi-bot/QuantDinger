# Security Policy

QuantDinger is a **local-first, self-hosted quantitative trading system**.

Security is a core design principle of the project, but it is important to
understand the **responsibility boundaries** that come with self-hosted software.

This document explains what we support, how to report vulnerabilities,
and what to expect from the process.

## 🔒 Supported Versions

QuantDinger is under active development.

At this stage:
- The **`main` branch** is the only supported version for security updates.
- Older commits, forks, or modified deployments are **not actively supported**.

Users are strongly encouraged to stay up to date with the latest release
or commit when running QuantDinger in production environments.

---

## 🧠 Security Model & Scope

QuantDinger is designed to run **entirely under the user’s control**.

### In Scope
We consider the following areas in scope for security review:

- Source code vulnerabilities in this repository
- Authentication and authorization logic within QuantDinger
- Handling of API keys, secrets, and credentials by the application
- Strategy execution logic and isolation boundaries
- Default configuration security issues

### Out of Scope
The following are outside the scope of this security policy:

- Misconfigured user environments (OS, Docker, firewall, cloud host)
- Compromised user machines or infrastructure
- Third-party services, exchanges, or APIs
- Modified or unofficial builds of QuantDinger

## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in QuantDinger,
we appreciate responsible disclosure.

### How to Report

Please **do not open a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately via email:

- **Email**: see the contact address listed in `README.md`
- **Subject**: `[Security] Brief description of the issue`

Please include:
- a clear description of the vulnerability
- steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- potential impact
- any suggested mitigations (optional)

---

## ⏱️ Response Expectations

We aim to:
- acknowledge reports within **72 hours**
- provide a preliminary assessment within **7 days**

Timelines may vary depending on the complexity and severity of the issue.

If a report is accepted, we will coordinate a fix and, when appropriate,
a responsible public disclosure.

---

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We ask security researchers to:
- avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond proof of concept
- allow reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure
- act in good faith and with respect for users

We are happy to acknowledge responsible disclosures
in release notes or documentation, if desired.

## Security Advisories

### July 2026 — JWT authentication and authorization bypass (resolved)

A critical vulnerability affected deployments that used the previously
published default `SECRET_KEY`. Under those conditions, an unauthenticated
attacker could forge an HS256 access token. The former validation path also
allowed a token without a `token_version` claim to bypass session-version
checks and used the role carried in the token for authorization decisions.

The issue was resolved on **July 21, 2026**. QuantDinger now rejects missing,
known-default, and fewer-than-10-byte signing secrets (32 or more random bytes
remain strongly recommended); requires the JWT identity and session claims;
and validates the current user status, token version, and role against the
authoritative database record before granting access.

Administrators of deployments created before this fix should update to the
latest supported revision, replace `SECRET_KEY` with a unique high-entropy
value, and require users to sign in again. If an affected API was reachable by
untrusted networks, review access logs and rotate any broker, exchange, or
provider credentials that may have been exposed.

### August 2026 — Strategy and indicator execution isolation

Deployments that accepted untrusted strategy or indicator code before the
August 2026 hardening update should assume application environment secrets may
have been exposed. Upgrade to the latest `main` revision, review access logs,
and rotate JWT/session secrets, database credentials, provider tokens, and
connected broker or exchange credentials. Preserve access to credentials
encrypted with the previous `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` until they have been
re-encrypted or re-entered; changing that key without a migration makes stored
credentials unreadable.

## Security Acknowledgments

- **Risma Ajul**, security researcher — responsibly disclosed the critical JWT
  authentication and authorization bypass resolved in July 2026. We sincerely
  thank Risma for the responsible report and for helping make QuantDinger safer.
- **Satrio**, independent security researcher — responsibly disclosed a
  critical runtime-built attribute-traversal issue in the strategy and
  indicator execution boundary in August 2026. The research was performed
  against the public repository only and did not access the hosted service or
  real user data.
- **Jo Arsy**, security researcher — responsibly disclosed an issue involving
  improper trust of client-supplied proxy IP headers in September 2026. The
  report helped strengthen QuantDinger's IP-based authentication and anti-abuse
  controls.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

QuantDinger is provided **as-is**, without warranty.

As a self-hosted system, users are responsible for:
- securing their own environments
- protecting API keys and credentials
- complying with applicable laws and regulations

Security is not a feature — it is a shared responsibility.

Thank you for helping keep QuantDinger safe.
